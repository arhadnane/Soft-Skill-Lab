## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Learning
1. **Start with Medium difficulty** - Not too easy, not too hard
2. **Try different styles** - Don't use Collaborative every time
3. **Read all feedback** - The turn-by-turn analysis is gold
4. **Complete 5 simulations** - Then check Analytics for patterns
5. **Set a daily goal** - Even 1 simulation/day builds skills

### For High Scores
1. **Collaborative + Assertive** usually score highest
2. **Avoid Passive and Manipulative** in most situations
3. **Read team mood** - Adjust to personality (shown at start)
4. **Consistency matters** - Changing styles mid-conversation can hurt trust
5. **Learn from mistakes** - Review why a choice scored low

### For Unlocking Achievements
1. **"First Steps"** - Complete 1 simulation (automatic!)
2. **"Team Player"** - Use Collaborative 10 times (most natural)
3. **"Explorer"** - Try each style at least once
4. **"On Fire"** - Practice daily for a week
5. **"Perfectionist"** - Aim for 95%+ (hard but possible!)
